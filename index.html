            SAM Labs is an EdTech company that provides software, hardware and content to teachers, creating the necessary confidence for
            teaching STEAM and coding to kids. My main role as UX/UI designer was to improve and redesign SAM Space, the flagship app for
            iOS, Android, Windows and Chromebook. While doing that, I had to keep in mind existing users, devices and content designed to be
            working with the app. At the same time, bluetooth hardware blocks needed to be easy to recognise and pair to the device,
            creating a seamless and “magic” experience. Talking to teachers and users in general to collect data and research alongside our
            UX researcher was one of the main task during the design process. I also had the opportunity to touch into different
            departments, like content and manufacture, to bring the same user experience across the company products.
