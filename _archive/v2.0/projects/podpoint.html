            <p>Pod Point is a leading UK provider of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. It provides charging units for home, business and public use.<br>

              My main role as Lead UX/UI designer here at Pod Point is to maintain the existing products, like the Pod Point App and services while working on new features and creating the products that are going to shape the future of the
              company.<br>

              As electric vehicles keep rising in popularity, so is demand for charging infrastructure and our products, which always offer a challenging experience when researching how to shape the future of a fairly new industry.<br>

              Talking and listening to user needs and feedback has been key in the creation and development of new products, while balancing the current industry tech limitations and expanding styling and brand guidelines.<br>

              Everyday working at Pod Point has been a full dive into an ever changing industry that still has a lot of complexities with a steep learning curve.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-4 mt-5">Pod Point App</h3>
            <hr>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <p>The Pod Point App is the heart of the home charge
                ecosystem.<br>
                From here you can explore and access the public
                charging network as well as managing your WiFi
                enabled homecharger and your charging data.<br><br>
                EV drivers have a particularly wide range of user
                persona that tend to condense in the range of 40+.<br>
                It was imperative to create a simple user experience
                that would benefit from consolidated design
                patterns that are easily recognisable.<br><br>
                Researches for all Pod Point products were carried
                out both internally and externally, tapping in our
                ever-growing customer base.<br>
                Design sprints were also used to kickstart new
                products and features but following a new
                redesigned structure to better fit the “working from
                home” environment.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>When I first started at Pod Point in 2020, the non-existent design system and brand guidelines were a bit dated and haven’t been updated for a few years prior to my start.<br><br>

              All products needed to be updated and uniformed to a consistent design system in order to bring clarity across our suite of product while improving the overall user experience.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
              <p>Offering a fleet management system has always been one of the main priority for the commercial side of the business..<br><br>

                Among our customers Mitie, DPD, Amazon and Sky to name a few, had the need to track usage and electricity expenses for their new EV fleet delivery vehicle.<br><br>

                We had to offer a solid solution that could help visualise multiple source of data as well as managing driver, vehicle and expenses.<br><br>

                Research and user interviews started well in advance in order to have enough time to better understand the problem we were going to solve but also creating a solution that could scale together with our customers fleet.<br><br>

                I had the opportunity to learn more about the needs and experiment with new ideas given how new the EV industry is.
                Lots of data needed to be managed in the process while displaying them in a simple and intuitive way was a key part of the success of our fleet solution.</p>
